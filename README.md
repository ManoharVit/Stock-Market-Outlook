## Project Structure

### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Source: Yahoo Finance (yfinance library)
- Notebook: `Preprocessing.ipynb`
- Derived time series: S&P 500 Prices, Returns, and Volatility

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Notebook: `Visualization and EDA.ipynb`
- Techniques: Line/Box Plots, Density Curves, Decomposition Plots, Smoothing Functions, Correlation Plots, Stationarity Tests

### Models

#### SARIMA
- For S&P 500 Returns: `Returns Models/SARIMA For SPX Returns.ipynb`
- For S&P 500 Prices: `Prices Models/ARMA Model for SPX Prices.ipynb`

#### ETS
- Notebook: `Returns Models/Exponential Smoothing Models for SPX Returns.ipynb`

#### GARCH
- For Volatility: `Volatility Models/GARCH for SPX Volatility.ipynb`

#### ARMA-GARCH

## Installation

Most packages used are standard in Python environments. For Facebook Prophet:

```
pip install fbprophet
```

Or in Google Colab:
